# Rainfall-prediction



## ðŸ“Œ Overview

This project applies **Machine Learning (ML)** techniques to predict **rainfall occurrence** (yes/no) using historical meteorological data. The model is trained using a **Random Forest Classifier**, optimized through **GridSearchCV**, and deployed via a **Flask web application** for real-time predictions.

---

##  Objective

- Build a predictive system for rainfall using historical weather data.
- Preprocess and clean meteorological data.
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to extract patterns.
- Train and optimize a machine learning model.
- Deploy the model in a user-friendly web app interface.

---

##  Dataset Description


- **Features (12 total):**
  - `pressure`, `maxtemp`, `mintemp`, `temperature`, `dewpoint`
  - `humidity`, `cloud`, `rainfall`, `sunshine`
  - `winddirection`, `windspeed`, `day`
- **Target variable:** `rainfall` (yes = 1, no = 0)

---

##  Methodology

### ðŸ”§ Data Preprocessing
- Filled missing values (mode/median)
- Removed redundant temperature-related features
- Encoded `rainfall` to binary
- Addressed class imbalance via downsampling

###  Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Histograms, boxplots, count plots
- Feature correlation analysis

###  Model Training
- Model: `RandomForestClassifier`
- Optimized using `GridSearchCV`
- Evaluated with accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score

###  Evaluation
- **Cross-validation Accuracy:** 81.15%
- **Test Accuracy:** 79.7%
- **Recall (Rain):** 90%
- **Top Features:** `cloud`, `sunshine`, `humidity`

###  Deployment
- Model saved using `pickle`
- Flask web app for user input and prediction
- Outputs predicted label and confidence scores
